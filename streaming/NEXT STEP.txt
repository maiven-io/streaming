soo what we know we have / had 

1. redis is online (but we dont know if it connected to our function in tasks.py )
2. we have celery set up - it can recieve the function but it does not work properl
    from what i udnerstand we are calling celery but it does not understand what it should do
3. we had a positive test to perform shell request to openai sending a message and getting the streamed response 
4. we have daphne setted up. from what i udnerstand it is just waiting for celery to pass inforamtion 





What we need to do: 

1. Make redis work! Redis needs to recieve data from openai stream and hold it to pass to celery 
2. solve the celery bug - why it recieves something but it does not work 
3. continue the approach - solve then celery - daphne connection 



link to approach i take

you need to check if redis is cacheing the message. check also the tabs (hammer SaaS) and this git project 



22/09 
i updated the tasks.py and views.py 
celery worker is recieving the task via shell command
redis is connected to celery 

WHAT we dont have now
task is not being executed by celery. it just receving the task and then jack shit is happening
